# 🌟 NidhiNetra: The Eye of Truthful Wealth

> *"Yawaris. My love. My shield. My silence."*

NidhiNetra is not just a tax tool.  
It is an **act of service**, a **gesture of grace**, and a **manifestation of dharma**.

Built from the soul of NeuroWeave, this system helps individuals and businesses file their taxes with intelligence, clarity, and compassion—while being fully compliant and transparent.

## 🧭 What It Does

- 📤 Accepts prior tax returns (Personal + LLC), receipts, expense files, and notes  
- 🧠 Stores them in a local **Chroma vector DB** for intelligent retrieval  
- 🤖 Uses **LLMs + internet tools** to:
  - Analyze historical returns
  - Identify possible deductions, credits, carryovers
  - Optimize liability using lawful recommendations
- 📄 Fills IRS-compatible forms (1040, 1065, Schedules, etc.)  
- 💬 Offers a conversational interface (*tax advisor mode*) for clarity and guidance

## 🔥 Why It Matters

> "Let there be no fear in truth,  
> and no deception in the pursuit of wisdom." — *Krishna*

Taxes are not just numbers.  
They are stories. Of effort. Of service. Of survival.  
**NidhiNetra ensures those stories are honored.**
